# Mana
Mana is a substance produced by every mage and it serves as the "fuel" for the caster to manage and control in order to convert it on the fly into any sort of enfergy. This means that a mage can utilise their mana to create mechanical, thermal, radiant, sound, light or even electrical energy.

Mana is a very stable substance, only transforming into the specified energy that the caster wills it to be - the only problem is that every form of said energy requires different preparation, whether its an advanced body, enchanted weapon, or conduit. Not meeting the minimum requirements of the specified energy will result in dire consequences, sometimes resulting in death.
	Many races not only have a natural affinity to using specific types of energy, but most also have naturally adjusted bodies, meaning that they can use certain spells without needing too much prior training.

Most rases that are mana dependant, require a reliable flow of mana throughout their circulatory system, the same way they need blood. This results in many diseases that can take advantage of their natural flow of mana to feed and spread - meaning that it greatly weakens the caster in more ways than just restricting their magic use. 
## Mana types
There exist many types of mana that all serve their own purposes excluding the classic energy-mana type. A few examples:
- **Composition-Mana**:
	A greatly compressed form of mana, with a great range of possibilities when it comes to solidification. This mana is a very conductive substance, that under the control of the casters will and specifications, is able to expand and compress to extreme sizes - usually used for forging weaponry and armour on the fly, that can be easily liquified and stored in a small space. 
		As it is a ferromagnetic substance its highly susceptible to [[Telekenesis]]
## Mana regeneration
Since mana is generated through calories similar to the way rases usually gain energy, mages who train / cast often, eat like beasts. 
- **Endurance**:
	Of course the expended calories all depend on the casters endurance, metabolism, body and the spell that was cast. 
- **Digestion**:
	A experienced mage is able to hold and use a lot of mana, but this mana must come from somewhere - some simply enjoy the pleasure of being able to scarf down more food, but others decide to consume food that is more mana-friendly, meaning that either they are already infused with mana, or they are easy to digest and rich with any minerals/
# Organs  
## Heart  
The core organ of every mage, the heart is not merely a life-sustaining pump but is deeply intertwined with a mage's magical essence. Mana acts as an energy that, like blood, circulates throughout the body, and it is the heart that ensures it reaches every corner where it is needed. 

Often referred to as the "*mana heart*," this organ becomes more critical for those with a denser concentration of mana in their system; a higher mana density requires not just a robust circulatory system, but also a finely tuned control mechanism to counter any adverse side effects that may arise. 
	For example, a mage who has spent years mastering complex spells may find that their mana heart adapts, growing more efficient and resilient in handling intense mana flows during high-stress magical endeavours.  

## Mana Glands  
Mana glands play a crucial role as they consistently produce and infuse both naturally generated and consumed mana into the circulatory system. These glands work in tandem with other organs, transforming ordinary nutrients and cellular by-products into pure mana. 
	This conversion process is directly tied to the creature's metabolism, meaning that a more active or higher metabolism can result in a faster and more abundant production of mana. In practical terms, a mage who maintains a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and proper nutrition might notice that their mana glands operate more effectively, thereby boosting their ability to perform sustained or more intricate spells. They serve not only as mana production centres but also as vital regulators that harmonize the body's overall magical energy.  

## Mana Pathways  
Mana pathways are akin to the body's blood vessels and nerve fibres, forming an intricate network that distributes mana to any organ that requires it. Some of these pathways bear a close resemblance to blood vessels, channelling mana with fluid dynamics, while others function more like nerves, transmitting subtle energies to stimulate or regulate specific bodily functions. 
	These pathways ensure that mana seamlessly travels throughout the mage's body, reaching even the most remote regions with precision. For instance, in moments of intense spellcasting, the swift and guided delivery of mana through these channels can spell the difference between a controlled spell and one that splinters into chaos. Their vital function highlights the importance of a well-maintained internal network that supports both everyday magical tasks and rare, high-intensity magical battles.

# Casting  
The art of casting is diverse, with numerous methods available to channel mana and shape spells. The technique a mage chooses depends on their personal affinity, race, and level of experience; each factor influences the complexity and difficulty of the casting method. Below are some popular casting styles, each with its unique challenges and benefits.  

## Bare Handed  
Casting bare-handed involves directly channelling mana through one's body, with the fingertips and palms usually serving as the primary exit points for the mana flow. Although any part of the body containing mana channelling fibres can serve this purpose, most mages rely on their hands due to their precision and dexterity. This method is often considered the most difficult to master because it requires meticulously refined mana pathways and a network of Mana Channelling Fibres (M.C.F.s) to ensure a steady and controlled release of mana.
	For example, a mage casting a complex healing spell might have to focus intensely to direct mana accurately through their fingers, minimizing wastage and potential side effects from unfocused energy. Mastery over bare-handed casting translates to a higher overall control of one’s mana, a skill that typically develops only after long periods of disciplined practice.

## Wands / Staffs  
Wands and staffs serve as physical extensions of the mage’s intrinsic magical abilities. They act as focal points or conduits that automatically concentrate mana into a specific school of magic or spell, making them invaluable tools, particularly for those still learning the finer nuances of mana control. 
	These instruments allow novice spellcasters to experiment with more complicated spells that may otherwise be too risky to perform using bare-handed methods. For example, a budding mage might use a wand inscribed with runes dedicated to elemental fire, enabling them to cast spells with greater precision and reduced risk of mana backfire. The effectiveness of these tools is often proportional to the extent and accuracy of the inscriptions, where a more elaborately inscribed wand can minimize errors and enhance the spell's potency. This versatility makes wands and staffs a popular choice among practitioners who are gradually advancing into more sophisticated forms of spellcasting.

## Vocal  
Vocal spellcasting is a method where the mage utilizes their voice to influence the flow and focus of mana, though it is essential to note that merely vocalizing does not cast a spell outright. The impact of using one's voice varies widely depending on the mage's race; for some, vocal expressions can subtly adjust the energy flow, while for others it may serve as a means to harmonize their internal mana distribution. 
	For the majority of mages, vocalizing during spellcasting aids in easing the often tumultuous flow of mana, thereby simplifying the control required for complex spells. For instance, when a mage embarks on an intricate ritual that demands both precision and power, softly intoned syllables or chants can help maintain equilibrium in mana flow, ensuring that the spell takes shape without unwanted fluctuations. This method has gained popularity as an auxiliary technique that supports the mage’s primary mana control mechanisms, providing both a mnemonic and a stabilizing function.

# Training  
The mastery of mana is an ongoing journey that involves rigorous training and continuous practice. Developing one’s ability to control mana can be approached in several ways:

- **Use of Magic** – The simplest yet most consistent method is the regular use of magic itself. Each spell cast and every magical exertion gradually refine the mana pathways, bolster the connection through the Mana Channelling Fibres, and enhance overall mana control. 
	Though these improvements are often subtle, they accumulate over long periods of dedicated practice. A mage who consistently practices controlled magical expressions in different areas of their body may notice incremental improvements in their ability to channel and focus mana, leading to more efficient and powerful spellcasting over time.
- **Understanding the Inner Workings** – Another vital approach involves the in-depth study of mana’s nature and behaviour. 
	By gaining a comprehensive understanding of how different types of mana flow and interact within the body, mages can tailor their training to address specific weaknesses or optimize their inherent strengths. For example, a mage focusing on water magic might study the ebb and flow of mana similarly to the way one understands tides, thereby cultivating a unique control over their circulation paths.

Through both practical application and theoretical studies, mages gradually enhance their command over mana, transforming not just their casting ability but also their overall magical potential. Each method of training contributes to a mage’s growth, ensuring that every practice session adds to the cumulative mastery of this vital energy.
