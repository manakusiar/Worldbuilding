# Mana Conversion
As mana is a powerful substance, with the extremely high potential to be converted into energy, can be transformed into a current, where the amperage and voltage depends on the manas "potency" / potential energy as well as they're specified efficiency and porpouse (a mage that prioritises long term use will have a higher voltage than one that would rather have a large amount of short term power). 
	The resistance of bodies current depends on the casters body. A  well-trained caster will have very efficient blood and organs that have a low resistance.

# Field Manipulation
The caster's mastery over their internal energy allows them to simply adjust the power of the mana currents, directly controlling the magnetic field's properties:
- **Control Knob**: 
	By adjusting the field's power (voltage / amperage) the caster can adjust the strength and speed of the manipulated objects.
- **Field spacing**:
	The caster can learn to direct the current through particular MCF pathways, essentially "sculpting" the magnetic field in space. This precise 

# Charging Materials
An advanced aspect of this magic system is the ability to “charge” external materials, making them responsive to the caster’s magnetic field:
- **Inducing Electric Currents in Materials:**  
    With the magnetic field generated, the caster can use their mana to induce a secondary electric current in target materials. This works best with conductive or ferromagnetic substances.
- **Creating Magnetic “Anchors”:**  
    By charging an object, the caster effectively turns it into a temporary electromagnet. This allows the caster to attract, repel, or move the object at will, much like the principles used in electromagnetic levitation.
- **Dynamic Interaction:**  
    The caster may adjust the charging current in real-time. For instance, increasing the charge on an object can make it more strongly attracted to their field, while reducing it can release the object or even cause repulsion.
