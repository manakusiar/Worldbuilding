Negative magic is a form of spellcasting that is practically known to none. It requires ungodly amounts of mana, precision, power and dedication. It's highly suggested or at times even required that the caster have incredible affinities in this area, otherwise this form of magic is going to be impossible to even start learning.

To create the simplest and smallest wormhole for just a minute, if done correctly would immediately siphon all the mana of the caster, close, disappear and leave nothing but the casters corpse behind.

As mentioned previously the users of said lifeblood usually belong to races that have long attuned, generation after generation, in order to cast this kind of magic and even their most powerful casters can only retain the wormhole for so long.

The generally accepted easiest form of manipulating space in such a manor goes as such:
1. **Attunement**:
	  - The caster has to attune a extreme amount of mana, this differs from person to person, from rase to rase and can be eased with the use of powerful artifacts. This is achieved by repeated use of negative magic, excessive study or artifacts. 
2. **Mana concentration** - [[Explanation#Casimir Effect as an Example|Explenation]]:
	- The casters mana has to be compressed, an incredible amount of both attuned and condensed energy to trigger the formation of the wormhole. This is purely a skill, and has to be mastered in order for the caster to be able to create a full personal use "portal". 
	- While naturally accruing wormholes require the energy of up to multiple collapsing stars to form, the ones we wish to create are far less "brute", more refined, smaller and much more stable. 
3. **Forming and upholding** - [[Explanation#Scaling Up Exotic Energy|Explenation]]:
	- This is by far the most difficult part which requires the caster to previously master the formation of mana into a form of "exotic matter". This is something that can be learnt by both understanding the concept and excessive practice. If the mage is unable to constantly create and bend the exotic mana to their will, then all the other steps up to this point are for not, since the wormhole will close almost immediately as the space binds and heals itself back together into its original form. 
	- A theoretical naturally occurring wormhole would require a form of exotic matter (usually negative energy), which in this case we will achieve by inputting a stable stream of mana, honed into such a state. Even if the caster is able to produce this kind of mana, the use and control over what, where and when it does is by far one of the most complicated and unusual form of magical manipulation that a mage can learn.
	- When the mage has successfully created a temporarily stable portal and is constantly feeding it a stream of mana the formation is complete - the portal is open and ready for use.

It is greatly important that the caster remembers that the stream of mana that they are pumping into sustaining the wormhole, can undergo some complications for the fist few times that the caster passes through it.

When a wormhole is closed while an something of mass is still passing through it the results are completely unpredictable.

For some it might simply move the entire object to one of the two sides - to others it might rip it apart on a either cellular or more commonly on a atomic level.
	For this reason it is highly suggested that the caster casts a spell like psychokinesis, in order to make sure that nothing is in the way of the closing gate.
