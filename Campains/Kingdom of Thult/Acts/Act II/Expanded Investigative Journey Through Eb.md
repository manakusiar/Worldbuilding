## 1. Gathering Local Rumors and Environmental Clues
- **Exploring the Streets:**
	- The party splits up to speak with vendors, street performers, and residents who frequent busy market squares.
	- They gather overheard snippets about “shadows that don’t belong” and “familiar faces erased from memory.”
- **Noticing Subtle Disturbances:**
	- Areas where graffiti or carvings feature strange symbols—a spiral pattern intertwined with a series of faded runes—are encountered in back alleys and near abandoned buildings.
	- Some of these symbols match descriptions from obscure local legends and hint at an ancient, underground power.
- **Investigating Public Spaces:**
	- The party visits the town hall, library, and a small museum dedicated to Eb’s history.
	- In these places, they find records of missing key figures and observe that important community roles have inexplicably become vacant.
	- They notice that official documents sometimes have erased names or references to positions that seemingly never existed.

## 2. Deciphering Cryptic Symbols and Artifacts
- **Uncovering the Meaning:**
	- The party collects fragments of carved symbols from walls, door frames, and even mundane objects that have been vandalized.
	- By comparing these symbols with lore from ancient texts or local bards’ songs, they begin to interpret them as possible markers for hidden passages or entrances.
- **Artifacts and Clues:**
	- A weathered medallion, found on the scene of a recent disappearance, bears a similar symbol.
	- A mysterious, half-burnt scroll recovered from a derelict building mentions “the passage beneath the earth” as the source of forgotten memories.
- **Collaborative Puzzle:**
	- Members of the party with skills in history, religion, or arcana are encouraged to work together to piece together the meaning of these clues.
	- Successful interpretation provides them with a rough sketch of a forgotten map indicating the location of an entrance to the ancient sewers.

## 3. Clandestine Meetings and Insider Tips
- **Whispers in the Shadows:**
	- Informants from secretive local factions (such as the subdued remnants of the Crimson Veil) or even disillusioned city guards hint at unusual activity in the lower districts of Eb.
	- A reluctant witness may report that a street urchin saw a door hidden behind an overgrown wall in a narrow alley—one that leads downward.
- **Secret Correspondence:**
	- The party finds a coded note left behind by a former city official who mysteriously vanished. The note hints at “the gate beneath the city where nightmares are born.”
	- Deciphering the code requires interaction with a reclusive scholar or a visit to a hidden section of the library, deepening the mystery.

## 4. Uncovering Disappearances and Memory Gaps
- **First-Hand Accounts:**
	- Interviews with those close to the missing—family members, friends, and colleagues—reveal common threads in the disappearances.
	- Each tale subtly references a sense of being watched or an inexplicable fog that makes memories fade.
- **Evaluating Discrepancies:**
	- The party’s own experience from the bandit campaign is compared against official records, highlighting anomalies.
	- They notice that even their heroic deeds have been partially “erased” in local lore, fueling suspicions of external interference.
- **Establishing the Connection:**
	- In piecing together interviews, physical evidence, and cryptic messages, the party starts to see a pattern emerging: the clues all converge on an entrance rumored to lead to ancient sewers.
	- The final piece of the puzzle is finding an inscription on a wall in a deserted part of the city that directly mentions “the song of many heads”—a clear nod to the false hydra legend.

## 5. The Final Clue: Entrance to the Ancient Sewers
- **Discovery of the Hidden Door:**
	- Following the map from the deciphered symbols and the insider tip, the party arrives at a forgotten courtyard on the outskirts of the city.
	- There, they find a nearly camouflaged iron door set into a crumbling wall, partly hidden by overgrown ivy and marked with the same spiral rune.
- **The Gateway Puzzle:**
	- Unlocking or opening the door may involve solving a puzzle that requires them to align symbols in the correct order.
	- The process is laced with small magical traps intended to deter the unworthy.
- **A Sense of Foreboding:**
	- As the door creaks open, a cool, damp draft and the echo of faint, otherworldly melodies greet them—hallmarks of the false hydra’s influence.
	- This discovery solidly points the party toward the ancient sewers, marking the transition from urban investigation to underground exploration.

This expanded investigative journey ensures that the players actively engage with various facets of the city, piecing together clues and solving puzzles that gradually lead them to the hidden entrance of the ancient sewers and, ultimately, to the fully grown false hydra that has been orchestrating the city's memory gaps.
