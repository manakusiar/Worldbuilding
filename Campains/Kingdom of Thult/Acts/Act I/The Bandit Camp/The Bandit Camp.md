# Act I: The Bandit Camp

## Scene 1: The Call to Adventure
- The party gathers at a lively seaside tavern in Eb.
	- Overhearing a hushed conversation about kidnappings from a nearby bandit camp.
	- A mysterious map fragment and whispered rumors hint at the location deep within the forest.
	- Players can initiate roleplay by questioning nervous patrons or discreetly eavesdropping on private discussions, using skills like Persuasion and Insight for more clues.

## Scene 2: Journey Through the Forest
- The party departs Eb in search of the bandit camp.
	- The forest is shrouded in dense mist; wildlife behaves erratically under some unseen influence.
	- **Interactive Encounters:**
		- The players encounter a wandering member of the Navigators’ Guild who offers guidance or caution.
		- Ambush by minor foes (bewildered forest creatures or low-level bandit scouts) providing an early test of teamwork.
	- Tactical decision points prompt players to choose their path:
		- Follow a well-trodden trail with potential for hidden dangers.
		- Explore a secret, overgrown path that might hide clues or additional threats.

## Scene 3: Infiltrating the Bandit Camp
- The party discovers a clearing dominated by a makeshift bandit stronghold.
	- The camp is fortified with crude barricades, scattered campfires, and organized patrols.
	- **Interactive Options:**
		- **Stealth Approach:** Study guard rotations and use distractions such as throwing stones, casting minor illusion spells, or setting off environmental traps.
		- **Direct Confrontation:** Engage the bandits head-on with coordinated attacks or negotiate terms if a sympathetic bandit is found.
	- Environmental storytelling elements:
		- Scattered belongings of kidnapped children and hastily scribbled notes.
		- A crudely painted map on a wooden board that might reveal additional secret passages or weak points in the camp defenses.

## Scene 4: The Rescue
- Deep within the camp, the party locates the holding area for the kidnapped children.
	- **Interactive Roleplay:**
		- Children have individual, memorable backstories that may influence the party’s emotional response.
		- Opportunity to choose between rapid extraction or careful planning to avoid alerting the entire camp.
	- **Decision Points:**
		- Whether to confront the bandit leader directly or try to appeal to any bandit with a change of heart.
		- Options for quickly securing the area via stealth, spells (for illusions or control), or setting traps for any pursuing bandits.

## Scene 5: The Ambush and Foreshadowing
- As the children are freed, an unexpected counterattack erupts from a more organized bandit faction.
	- **Dynamic Combat and Tactical Shifts:**
		- Reinforcements arrive, forcing the players to adapt using environmental advantages (e.g., barricading narrow pathways, collapsing makeshift structures).
		- Encourage creative uses of party abilities to hold off the ambush.
	- Amidst the skirmish, players notice strange symbols on the bandits’ banners and whispered chants that hint at dark, arcane influences.
		- This subtle clue plants the seed of a larger mystery, foreshadowing the presence of a false hydra manipulating events from within the sewers of Eb.

This setup ensures each player can engage through exploration, roleplaying, tactical combat, and problem-solving, making the act both interesting and interactive, with the outcomes directly influenced by their choices.
