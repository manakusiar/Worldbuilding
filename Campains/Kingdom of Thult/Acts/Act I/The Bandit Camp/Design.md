  ## 1. Camp Location & Natural Defenses

- **Forest Glen & Cliffside:** Nestled where dense pines meet craggy shale cliffs, the camp is reachable only by a narrow, winding path or via a hidden rope‐and‐wooden‐ladder approach at low tide.
    
- **Water Feature:** A small waterfall and creek babble through the camp’s edge, masking noise and providing fresh water—but also a natural hazard where careless footsteps can slip into hidden pools.
    
- **Rocky Outcrops:** Overlooking rocks serve as improvised watch‐posts and sniper perches for crossbowmen, forcing players to contend with verticality.
    

## 2. Camp Layout & Defenses

- **Sectional Design (Avoids All‑Out Assault):** Split the camp into three main sectors—outer sentry zone, central living/storehouse area, inner leadership enclave—to let players tackle one zone at a time.
    
- **Palisade Walls & Crude Barricades:** Sharp wooden stakes and overturned wagons channel intruders into narrow kill zones.
    
- **Traps & Hazards:**
    
    - **Hidden Pitfalls:** Covered pits with spikes or acid pools inflict damage and slow pursuers.
        
    - **Alarm Traps:** Tripwires tied to tin cans or bells alert guards to stealthy intruders.
        

## 3. Key Areas & Interactive Features

### 3.1 Outer Sentry Zone

- **Watch Towers:** Two wooden towers with ladders, each manned by 1–2 archers using hit‐and‐run tactics.
    
- **Guard Patrols:** Small roving groups (3–4 bandits) use coordinated flanking maneuvers.
    

### 3.2 Central Living & Storehouse

- **Tents & Fire Pits:** Eight tents arranged around central bonfires; discarded children’s belongings (toys, blankets) lie among rough‐hewn tables, hinting at the captives’ presence.
    
- **Supply Wagons & Crates:** Contain stolen goods, rations, and a locked chest holding a minor magical trinket—perhaps a potion of water breathing or a scroll of fog cloud—to spice up the encounter.
    
- **Makeshift Shrine:** A crudely carved wooden idol bearing strange sigils; a lower‐level lieutenant uses it to scry or bolster morale.

### 3.3 Inner Leadership Enclave

- **Captain’s Tent:** A larger, richly furnished tent with maps, a ledger of kidnappings, and personal items (a locket engraved with a child’s name) that serve as emotional clues.
    
- **Sergeants’ Quarters:** Three adjacent rooms where sergeants rest and plan; each room has simple locks and one sergeant is an ex‐soldier who might be persuaded to bargain.
    
- **Hidden Tunnel Entrance:** Concealed beneath a loose floorboard in the captain’s tent, leading into Eb’s sewers—your hook to the False Hydra.

## 4. NPCs & Tactics

- **Bandit Captain, “Harrow the Cruel”:** Wields dual scimitars, uses intimidation, and stays behind sergeants until PCs are weakened.
    
- **Arcane Lieutenant, Marwen the Whisperer:** A former mage who provides subtle magical support (darkvision, silence spells) and can turn the tide if confronted.
    
- **Sergeants (3× Thug Stat Blocks):** Coordinate ambushes, call for reinforcements, and use hit‑and‑run tactics from cover.
    

## 5. Dynamic & Environmental Encounters

- **Forest Ambush:** As PCs approach, hidden archers fire volleys from treetops, triggering one or two wandering patrols for a multi‑front skirmish.
    
- **Waterfall Chase:** If PCs try to flank via the creek, slippery rocks and narrow ledges impose Acrobatics checks or risk falling into the water.
    
- **Nighttime Howls:** Occasional wolf calls—whether real or summoned by Marwen—raise tension and encourage players to spread out.
    

## 6. Clues & Foreshadowing

- **Strange Symbols:** Painted on tent flaps and the idol in the shrine—symbols that match graffiti found near Eb’s sewers.
    
- **Missing Memories:** NPCs rescued from the camp speak of “nothing” once they’re safely in Eb, hinting at memory‐warping magic.
    
- **Children’s Toys:** A child’s ragged doll with a sewn‑on patch bearing the crest of Eb—reinforces the kidnapping and tugs at PCs’ emotions.

## 7. Loot & Rewards

- **Standard Spoils:** Gold (200 gp), gems (3 × 50 gp), and trade goods stolen from Eb’s merchants.
    
- **Magical Item:** A potion of water breathing or scroll of fog cloud—useful in infiltration of flooded sewers.
    
- **Quest Hook:** The ledger and locket containing names tied to the sewers—point players toward Act II’s False Hydra beneath Eb.
