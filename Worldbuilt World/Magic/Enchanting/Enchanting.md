# Runes
Runes are more than mere carvings; they are ancient inscriptions meticulously carved by skilled hands and filled with a carefully selected material. This process transforms them into powerful conduits, designed to either hold or focus mana with precise efficiency. For example, a rune might be etched into the surface of a weapon and then charged with crystalline compounds to enhance its interaction with magical energies.
	The primary purpose of these runes is to imbue the weapon with specific effects or affinities that go beyond mere embellishment. At one level, runes can introduce minor effects, such as ensuring that an object remains extra sharp or gains enhanced durability. Imagine a warrior’s blade that, when adorned with a series of finely tuned runes, consistently maintains a razor edge in the midst of battle or resists wear against enchanted armour.
On a more significant scale, these inscriptions are capable of channelling major spell-enhancing magic. By aligning their inherent properties with particular types of magic, runes can assist a caster during powerful spellcasting rituals. 
- For instance, a wand inscribed with carefully chosen runes might amplify fire spells or boost healing energies, thereby providing a substantial advantage in both offensive and defensive magical warfare. 
- This dual possibility—from minor matter manipulation effects to advanced magical enhancements—demonstrates the versatility and immense potential that runes offer to both craftsmen and mages alike.

# Enchanting

Enchanting is the art of inscribing runes onto an object, a practice that marries the physical rigor of artisan labour with the ethereal qualities of magic. This process requires not only extraordinary skill but also a profound understanding of both the material and mystical realms. Only those who have dedicated their lives to mastering this intricate discipline — with countless hours of study, repeated failures, and eventual success—can successfully inscribe high-level runes that hold strong and enduring power. The enchanting process involves selecting the perfect rune for the intended effect, carefully choosing the proper chiselling tool, and finally, imbuing the object with specific magical energies.
