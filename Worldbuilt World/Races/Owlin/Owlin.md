Owlin are owl-like humanoid creatures renowned for their silent flight, heightened perception, and elegant mannerisms.

Owlin are gifted with an exceptionally potent magical physiology. While many races possess a "magic heart" and mana glands that facilitate their connection to magic, the owlin's organs are naturally superior in strength and efficiency. Their magic heart pumps mana through their system with remarkable vigor, and their glands produce this energy far more effectively than those of an average human. This heightened efficiency not only fuels their magical prowess but also enhances their overall vitality and endurance in both physical and mystical endeavors.
