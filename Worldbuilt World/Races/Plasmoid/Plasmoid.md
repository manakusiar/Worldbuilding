Plasmoids are amorphous entities that arise from the natural convergence of magical energy—commonly known as mana—with environmental elements. Although their form is fluid and can subtly shift in the presence of other beings, they possess distinct characteristics that set them apart from all other races.

Under rare and specific conditions, when a high concentration of ambient mana interacts with a liquid medium, a nascent plasmoid may emerge. During this phenomenon, the mana organizes itself into intricate, non-neural patterns that do not immediately resemble any conventional life form. Over time, the plasmoid begins to adopt features reminiscent of its surroundings, hinting at an adaptive mimicry rooted in its magical origins.

Plasmoids maintain their structure through internal astral manipulation combined with a basic form of psychokinesis. This dual mechanism not only facilitates their movement and camouflage but also enables them to coalesce from a diffuse, "puddle-like" state into a more defined entity. The transformation process is gradual—often taking months or even years—during which an internal astral gland develops to regulate mana flow and sustain their existence.
